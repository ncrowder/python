### Boxplot issue
I tried to use **df.plot(kind = 'box', by = column)** or **df.plot.box(by = column)** today in class and couldn't get it to work.  I knew that I had used it before, but it was because I had used the original boxplot call **df.boxplot(by=column)** instead of the new version that uses the plot accessor, instead directly calling boxplot on the dataframe itself.  The colab has been updated accordingly.  

### Lineplot issue
Additionally, and I'm a bit embarrased to admit I didn't realize it sooner, I now know why using df.plot(x='year') was producing what appeared to be the correct series (broken out by age group), but straight lines that appeared to be connecting up pieces of the data as well.  As pointed out, when you call the plot method in this way it doesn't even look at the 'age group' column (which we confirmed by plotting the same series without the 'age group' column and getting the same result).  But the reason it puts in those straight lines is because it is connecting *every* x = df['Year'] and y = df['Death Rate'] pair together for the *entire* dataframe.  This means that the LAST rate corresponding to the '1-4 Years' group is connecting to the FIRST point from the '5-9 Years' group, etc.  This also explains why there is one fewer "straight line" than there are separate series.
